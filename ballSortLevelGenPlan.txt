level generator:
#change Game complete screen to scene 1. Now all levels will have their buildIndex be 1 higher that the level name.


Select difficulty: choose a number of tubes
Select amount of ball colour: number of tubes - 2
select ball colours: numbers 0-8 each number relating to a colour

Create Scene using template with correct number of tubes
Add balls into tubes randomly: max number of balls per colour, cannot add into last 2 tubes
run AutoChild.AutoAssignChildren();

Solve to ensure playable?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
int difficulty = random(0-11);
for (int i; i < difficulty-2; i++)
{
	int colours[] = colours.add(random(0-> difficulty-2));
}

unity duplicate scene with name $('Tubes' {difficulty})

create ballObject colours[0], place in random tube(0->difficulty-2)(transform(tube.transform.x, tube.y + 1) need a check to ensure balls are placed above not on top of eachother
do that until 4 balls of each colour are placed in the scene.


UnityEditor add new scene last buildIndexNumber + 1
name scene $"Level {lastBuildIndexNumber}"
